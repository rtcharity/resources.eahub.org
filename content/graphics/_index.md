These pages contain links to numerous resources that may be useful for groups. While some resources are able to be printed or used online as is, most will require editing using <a target="_blank" href="https://designer.gravit.io/">Gravit</a> which is a free graphics package that can be used in your web browser.  

The EA Hub Resources team chose to make our files in Gravit as the free version has many excellent features, and it is easier to use than many other similar apps. This means that group organisers can make, share, and modify resources freely.

_More editable graphics will be added over time. Please_ <a target="_blank" href="/contact/">_contact us_</a> _if you have existing graphics to share or requests for graphics._
