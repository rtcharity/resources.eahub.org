# Self-care and Mental Health
EA can demand a lot from people, and there is a sense of urgency to act, but it is important to do so in a healthy way. Self-care is about making sure that you take care of your mental and physical health, and that you do not do altruistic things at the cost of your own personal health. 

“We don't need people making sacrifices that leave them drained and miserable. We need people who can walk cheerfully over the world” - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html">Cheerfully</a> by Julia Wise. 
## EAs on self-care
Many people in the EA community have contributed advice and shared their experiences about being an altruist:

# Value Drift and Staying Motivated

Most people in the EA community are young, and therefore their greatest impact could lie in the medium- to long-term, when they are at the peak of their careers. However, not everyone in the EA community will continue to act according to effective altruism principles throughout their lives. 

“Value drift” is a term used to describe various ways people greatly reduce or cease their altruistic actions. The causes could be a change in values, a loss of motivation, or a change in lifestyle. The percentage of people drifting away from EA has been estimated by Peter Hurford <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bGcKJiBt4HSSScF76/ea-survey-2018-series-how-long-do-eas-stay-in-ea">using the EA Survey data</a>, and by Joey in <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mZWFEFpyDs3R6hD3r/empirical-data-on-value-drift">"Empirical Data on Value Drift"</a>.
Marisa Jurczyk conducted a <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jG8pptGksBpzyTxYg/a-qualitative-analysis-of-value-drift-in-ea-1">qualitative analysis of value drift in EA</a>.

If you are highly motivated now, but think you are likely to experience value drift, you may wish to focus on having an impact in the short term. 

Also you may wish to take action now to reduce the chances that your values and motivations will change. For practical things you can do to make it less likely for you to change your values, and more likely for you to remain motivated, see the tips in Marisa Jurczyk's <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jG8pptGksBpzyTxYg/a-qualitative-analysis-of-value-drift-in-ea-1">qualitative analysis</a>, and this list in Darius Meissner's <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eRo5A7scsxdArxMCt/concrete-ways-to-reduce-risks-of-value-drift-and-lifestyle">"Concrete Ways to Reduce the Risk of Value Drift"</a>. 
 
Note that while it seems reasonable to take steps to keep your motivation high, it is debatable whether we should take steps to prevent your values from changing as it is possible that your future self will have better values than your current self.
