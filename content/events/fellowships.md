EA fellowships usually meet multiple times to teach a small group of admitted fellows about some aspect of effective altruism. When marketed as prestigious and targeted at younger students, fellowships can make excellent recruitment tools for uni group. Some uni groups have launched with a fellowship before later introducing other club activities.

Fellowships can have more consistent attendance than regular clubs, but they typically need a strong initial advertisement period to reach a decently large applicant pool. 

A fellowship might be a good fit for your group if your group organisers:

* Are confident at public speaking and facilitating discussions
* Have plenty of time before and during the semester to plan and execute the fellowship
* Have good organisational skills
* Are very familiar with EA

Fellowships are usually advertised as prestigious and selective. They often expect a high level of commitment from participants, which participants will expect to be reflected in the effort put in by organisers. Therefore, it is important that you only commit to running a fellowship if you are confident you can organise it reliably well throughout its duration.

# General EA Fellowship 

## Arete Fellowship

The most popular EA fellowship is the Arete Fellowship, which was first designed by Harvard EA and later replicated in a number of other universities. This fellowship aims to provide a complete education in EA concepts for newcomers.

This <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BSwUdewEI_IIkx2jtHECbN4wkI4P8Afw">Google Drive folder</a> maintained by Harvard EA includes all necessary materials to run an Arete Fellowship. Start with the <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vovG4UymDb7-ToyzswsNyoPS4Y9ahZoo_6Ci1505lAE">Arete Fellowship Guide</a>, which explains how the fellowship works and gives advice on how to make it successful. If you organise a similar fellowship, you can make copies of Harvard’s resources and modify them to suit your own group.

This <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4GkAtcMohxK2m2bXH/the-arete-fellowship">post on the EA Forum</a> describes the experience Harvard EA has had with running the fellowship.


Stephen Casper (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:thestephencasper@gmail.com">thestephencasper@gmail.com</a>) from Harvard EA can give you advice if you are interested in running a similar fellowship. 

## Yale EA Fellowship

Yale runs a similar fellowship to Arete, but with a larger giving game component (the “Impact Challenge”) which focuses exclusively on global health and poverty. 


<a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/suGcEobbHZZ4Gspeh/a-guide-to-effective-altruism-fellowships">This post on the EA Forum</a> describes how the Yale Fellowship works, and has links to all relevant  resources. Joshua Monrad (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:joshua.monrad@yale.edu">joshua.monrad@yale.edu</a>) from Yale EA can give you advice if you are interested in running a similar fellowship.

# Careers Fellowships

Some uni groups also run fellowships focussing on effective career paths. More information about these fellowships will be added soon.
