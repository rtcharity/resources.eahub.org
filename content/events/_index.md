# _These pages are a work in progress. We will be adding many more resources for running events in the coming months._

## Types of Events - Coming Soon
This page will have an overview of the types of EA events your group could run, and suggestions on which events would suit your group.

## Guide to Running an Event - Coming Soon
This page will have information on how to plan events, and tips to ensure your event goes well.

## [Discussion Groups](/events/discussions/)
Discussion groups are the most common event that EA groups run. They involve people reading, viewing or listening to content - then discussing! This page includes plenty of suggested content with questions to get the discussion going, and tips on facilitating a interesting and positive discussion.

## [Introductory Presentations](/events/intro/)
These workshops and presentations are designed for audiences that are unfamiliar with effective altruism. They could be used for newcomers events, or for presenting to non-EA groups.

## Intermediate Workshops - Coming Soon
These workshops are designed for audiences that are familiar with effective altruism, but haven’t necessarily read a lot about EA concepts and cause areas.


## Clubs Fairs and Tabling (Uni Groups) - Coming Soon
The clubs fair (otherwise known as Freshers’ Fair,  Activities’ Fair or Orientation) is the annual or bi-annual student extracurricular fair most Universities host at the beginning of the term. This is an excellent opportunity to find new people (especially first-years) to get involved in your EA group.


## [Fellowships (Uni Groups)](/events/fellowships)
EA fellowships involve a small group of admitted fellows gaining a complete education in introductory EA concepts over the course of several weeks. This page is a guide for uni groups running fellowships.
