### [Guide to Running an Event](/events/guide/)
This page has information on how to plan events, and tips to ensure your event goes well.

### [Venues](/events/venues/)
Ideas and considerations when choosing a venue for your event.

### [Food and Drink](/events/food/)
Tips on event catering.

### [Discussion Groups](/events/discussions/)
Discussion groups are the most common event that EA groups run. They involve people reading, viewing or listening to content - then discussing! This page includes plenty of suggested content with questions to get the discussion going, and tips on facilitating an interesting and positive discussion.

### [Introductory Presentations](/events/intro/)
These workshops and presentations are designed for audiences that are unfamiliar with effective altruism. They could be used for newcomers events, or for presenting to non-EA groups.

### [Social Events](/events/social/)
A variety of ideas and resources for running structured and unstructured social get-togethers. 

### [Speaker Events](/events/speaker/)
Speaker events involve a guest speaker giving a presentation, workshop, Q&A, or panel discussion. This guide will help you invite and prepare for speaker events.

### Intermediate Workshops - _Coming Soon_
These workshops are designed for audiences that are familiar with effective altruism, but haven’t necessarily read a lot about EA concepts and cause areas.


### Clubs Fairs and Tabling (Uni Groups) - _Coming Soon_
The clubs fair (otherwise known as Freshers’ Fair,  Activities’ Fair or Orientation) is the annual or bi-annual student extracurricular fair most Universities host at the beginning of the term. This is an excellent opportunity to find new people (especially first-years) to get involved in your EA group.


### [Fellowships (Uni Groups)](/events/fellowships)
EA fellowships involve a small group of admitted fellows gaining a complete education in introductory EA concepts over the course of several weeks. This page is a guide for uni groups running fellowships.

### [Retreats](/events/retreats)
Retreats involve community members gathering for two or more days, usually out of the city. The activities vary from social activities, career planning, intensive workshops, and working on projects.
