# Guidance from the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA)
The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/team/#groups-team">groups team at CEA</a> are the main source of support for groups. They are happy to schedule calls with group organisers. You can reach them at <a target=”_blank” href="mailto:groups@centreforeffectivealtruism.org">groups@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a>. 
 

# Connect with Other Group Organisers
Talking to other group organisers can be very helpful for finding answers, reassurance, and tips you may not have come across yet.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/956362287803174/">EA Group Organizers Facebook group</a> is a great place to ask questions. There is also an <a target="_blank" href="https://eagroups.slack.com/">EA Groups Slack workspace</a>, where you can share resources and ask questions. Ask the CEA Groups Team, or a fellow EA group organiser to invite you to the workspace. 

Here are some ways to find other groups to ask if they’d be willing to give you a hand:

* Search on the <a target="_blank" href="https://eahub.org/groups/">EA Hub</a>
* Search for “[nearby city or university] Effective Altruism” on Facebook

If you are running a uni group, it’s also a good idea to talk to some organisers of other clubs at your university. They might be able to give you a sense of how to navigate policies, publicise events, and tailor general club-running advice to your university in particular.

# Get a Website and an EA Email Address

The Local Effective Altruism Network (LEAN) can host and help create a website for your group. 

LEAN can register a domain for your group (e.g. eamadison.org) and you can use LEAN’s website generator to make a nearly complete website, which you can modify. Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eamadison.org/">EA Madison’s site</a> for an example of how the website could look:. 

<p class="large_image_wrapper">

</p>


LEAN can also provide email addresses for your group (e.g. info@eamadison.org), which can be forwarded to another email address if you wish. 

Contact the LEAN team at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:lean@eahub.org">lean@eahub.org</a> if you are interested in getting websites or email addresses. 

# Apply for Funding
If your group is a registered uni group, you can apply for funding through your Student Association. For funding city groups, or if your uni group needs additional funding, you can apply to CEA. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/mentorship-and-funding/">Group funding</a> can be used for printing, running events, supplying food at events, travel expenses for speakers, and group projects. CEA also funds Community Building Grants to allow some people to work part or full time on effective altruism community building.
