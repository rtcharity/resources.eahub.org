Groups thrive when they’re led by committed, talented, and hardworking organisers. If they’re not handed off to enthusiastic and competent people when organisers leave, the group may become less active or go entirely defunct. Succession problems are a frequent killer of good groups. 

This is a particular problem for uni groups, which are robbed of organisers every time one graduates. Good leadership handovers don’t always happen automatically: here are some tips to make your handover go smoothly. These are mostly written with uni groups in mind, but some will also be of use to city groups.  

# Getting in a Good Position Early

Long before you are in a position to decide on a successor, you can take steps to ensure you have a large pool of candidates to choose from when the time comes. Each year, focus on recruiting first-year students so your members don’t all graduate at the same time. Let promising younger students take over responsibilities gradually in order to give them more leadership experience and get a better understanding of their fit for group leadership. EA Cambridge has formalised this process into a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MZd5PLpGWC-jnCNqrnlRVetruE7fOkVRjfrRX7885gg/edit?usp=sharing">Mentorship Program</a>.

# Consider Leadership Transitions in your Committee Structure

Some uni groups have chosen to design their committee structure to help transitions. 
 
Some groups have have two co-organisers from different class years run the group, each for two years, so that there will never need to be a total leadership handover

Choose a new organiser two years before they graduate, and have the previous organiser become an advisor their final year (this has the advantage of avoiding lessening the responsibilities of organisers in their senior years, during which they might be writing a thesis or searching for jobs).

# How to Select your Successor 

Choose next year’s leadership early—ideally at least three months before you hand over responsibilities to them. Be sure that they have a solid understanding of EA and of the group’s purpose. If possible, choose someone who is familiar with the existing community and who has already helped you organise the group in some capacity. 

# The Handover Period

Some groups have organisational structures where leadership will be turned over from one team to an entirely different team. In these cases, make sure you:

* Have a period of time in which you can show new organisers the ropes by discussing decision with them and letting them sit in on strategy meetings
* Emphasise to your successor that you’re happy to be contacted by them in future whenever they want more support (if this is the case)
* Ensure anyone else in your group handing over leadership responsibilities to a successor also meets one on one with their replacement to pass on any specific knowledge or advice

# How to Write Handover Documents 

When possible make handover documents to explain in writing what your successors will need to know to run the group in your absence. This is particularly important if your group’s committee is changing substantially, but may not be as crucial when the new committee has been thoroughly involved. 

If multiple organisers are handing over their responsibilities, encourage them to each write their own sections for the document, and include everyone’s contact details so that successors can ask for further information. Make the document as readable as possible (e.g. by having bullet points instead of long paragraphs), so that your successors will actually use it.
