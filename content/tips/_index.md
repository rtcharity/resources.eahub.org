These pages provide tips on how to run a thriving EA group. 

Most of these tips come from US, UK, and Australian groups, so some aspects may not be relevant to your group, and while some of the tips are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_F8gJ69X-gDBeCWoN50iL5UzPBxV8DE/view">empirical evidence</a>, much of the content comes from anecdotal information supplied by group organisers.
